## Learning Apach Spark with Python - Korean Edition

The repository is filled with content about Korean language Notes for learning Apache Spark with Python.

The PDF version can be downloaded from [HERE](https://github.com/pinkyellowzebra/Learning-Apache-Park-with-Python-Kor/blob/main/%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%B4%EC%8D%AC%EC%9C%BC%EB%A1%9C%20%EB%B0%B0%EC%9A%B0%EB%8A%94%20%EC%95%84%ED%8C%8C%EC%B9%98%20%EC%8A%A4%ED%8C%8C%ED%81%AC%20(3).pdf).

In the Korean edition, I slightly modified the code and contents of the English edition of the note.

The English edition was posted on Github in ChenFeng ([Feng2017]). 

The reader is referred to the repository https://github.com/runawayhorse001/LearningApacheSpark for more details about the dataset and the .ipynb files.
