## Learning Apach Spark with Python - Korean Edition

The repository is filled with content about Korean language Notes for learning Apache Spark with Python.

The PDF version can be downloaded from [HERE](https://github.com/hongeunhee/LearningApachSparkwithPython_Kor/blob/main/%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%B4%EC%8D%AC%EC%9C%BC%EB%A1%9C%20%EC%95%84%ED%8C%8C%EC%B9%98%20%EC%8A%A4%ED%8C%8C%ED%81%AC%20%ED%95%99%EC%8A%B5%ED%95%98%EA%B8%B0.pdf).

In the Korean edition, I slightly modified the code and contents of the English edition of the note.

The English edition was posted on Github in ChenFeng ([Feng2017]). 

The reader is referred to the repository https://github.com/runawayhorse001/LearningApacheSpark for more details about the dataset and the .ipynb files.
